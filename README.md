## üìã Requirements

- PHP ^8.1
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- Core: [Telegram Git Notifier](https://github.com/cslant/telegram-git-notifier)

## üîß Installation

As for the installation and configuration,
this project provides two different installation ways depending on your preference or suitability for your system.

> **Way 1:** Install by composer directly on the system (Requires the system to install composer, previous PHP version)
> 
> **Way 2:** Install by Docker (Requires the system to install Docker, Docker Compose)

### I. Installation and configuration üõ†

Please choose only one of the following two ways to set up the project.

<details open>

<summary><b>Way 1: Install by composer directly on the system ‚öô</b></summary>
<br/>

First, please clone and install this project via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer create-project cslant/telegram-git-notifier-app
```

After running the command above, you will have the project installed under the `telegram-git-notifier-app` directory,
and the environment file `.env` will be created automatically.

Some of the JSON files will be created automatically in the `storage` directory.
These files are used to store the data and serve for features in this bot.

#### 1. Create a New Bot

To create a new bot, you need to talk to [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and follow a few simple steps.

1. Open a chat with [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and send `/newbot` command.
2. Enter a friendly name for your bot. This name will be displayed in contact details and elsewhere.
3. Enter a unique username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: `TetrisBot` or `tetris_bot`.
4. Copy the HTTP API access token provided by [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and paste it into your `.env` file.

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
```

#### 2. Set up your domain and SSL certificate

**We recommend that you use HTTPS to set up your domain and webhook.**
You can build your own server or use a service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

In this example, we will use localhost and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to set up the domain and webhook:
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Go to this project directory and run the command in the terminal: `php -S localhost:8000`
3. Continue to run the command in the terminal: `ngrok http 8000`
4. Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok and paste it into your `.env` file.

```dotenv
TGN_APP_URL=https://123456789.ngrok.io
```

#### 3. Get your Chat ID and add it to the .env file

1. Open a chat with your bot.
2. Send any message to your bot. (This handle needs to get your chat ID)
3. Go to the following URL: `<TGN_APP_URL>/webhooks/getUpdate.php`
4. Look for the `"chat":{"id":` field and copy the number after it. This is your Chat ID.
5. Paste the Chat ID in your `.env` file.

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_BOT_CHAT_ID=123456789
```

At this time, the source launch process is done, please skip way 2 and go to step [II. Set the webhook](#ii-set-the-webhook) to continue.

<details>

<summary><b>Way 2: Install by Docker :whale:</b></summary>
<br/>

> **Note:** This way requires the system to install Docker and Docker Compose. 
> 
> ‚ö† **If you set up the project by way one, please skip this way.** üö∏
> 
>And go to step [II. Set the webhook](#ii-set-the-webhook) to continue.

First, please clone this project and copy the environment file `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:cslant/telegram-git-notifier-app.git
cd telegram-git-notifier-app
cp .env.example .env
```

#### 1. Update the environment variables

Open the `.env` file and update the following variables:

```dotenv
PHP_VERSION_SELECTED=8.2
APP_PORT=3180

# You can customize the container name to suit your needs using GitHub and GitLab
CONTAINER_NAME=tgn-app
```

> **Note:** 
> 
> - The `PHP_VERSION_SELECTED` variable is the PHP version you want to use in the container.
> - The `APP_PORT` variable is the port of the container. (Please don't set the same port as the host)
> - The `CONTAINER_NAME` variable is the name of the container you want to create.

#### 2. Install and run the container

Run the following command to install and run the container:

```shell
bash ./docker.sh
```

Some of the JSON files will be created automatically in the `storage` directory.
These files are used to store the data and serve for features in this bot.

#### 3. Create a New Bot

To create a new bot,
you need to talk to [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and follow a few simple steps.

1. Open a chat with [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and send `/newbot` command.
2. Enter a friendly name for your bot. This name will be displayed in contact details and elsewhere.
3. Enter a unique username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: `TetrisBot` or `tetris_bot`.
4. Copy the HTTP API access token provided by [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and paste it into your `.env` file.

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
```


#### 4. Set up your domain and SSL certificate

In this way, we use the proxy in the container and [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to set up the domain and webhook:
1. Check the proxy of the container: `docker inspect <CONTAINER_NAME>-nginx | grep IPAddress`

> **Note:** Replace `<CONTAINER_NAME>` with the name of the container in .env file.

Example:

![image](https://github.com/cslant/lemp-docker/assets/35853002/8dc8ba3f-b1e9-4bff-901d-6bb7747acda4)

2. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Continue to run the command in the terminal: `ngrok http <CONTAINER_IP>`

> **Note:** Replace `<CONTAINER_IP>` is the IP address of the container in step 1.

Example:

```bash
ngrok http 172.28.0.3
```

3. Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok and paste it into your `.env` file.

```dotenv
TGN_APP_URL=https://123456789.ngrok-free.app
```

#### 5. Get your Chat ID and add it to the .env file

1. Open a chat with your bot.
2. Send any message to your bot. (This handle needs to get your chat ID)
3. Go to the following URL: `<TGN_APP_URL>/webhooks/getUpdate.php`
4. Look for the `"chat":{"id":` field and copy the number after it. This is your Chat ID.
5. Paste the Chat ID in your `.env` file.

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_BOT_CHAT_ID=123456789
```

</details>

### II. Set the webhook

We have two ways to set the webhook:

#### 1. Set the webhook from this project

After setting up your domain and SSL certificate, you need to set up the webhook for your bot. 

**Go to:**

```text
<APP_URL>/webhooks/set.php
```

> **Note:** Replace `<APP_URL>` with your app URL in .env file.

If you see the following message, it means that the webhook has been sent successfully.

```json
{"ok":true,"result":true,"description":"Webhook was set"}
```

[//]: # (status image)

#### 2. Set the webhook manually from Telegram

If you want to set the webhook manually, you can use the following URL:

```url
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourTelegramBotToken>/setWebhook?url=<APP_URL>
```

> **Note:** Replace `<YourTelegramBotToken>` with your bot token and `<APP_URL>` with your app URL in the `.env` file.

### III. Add chat IDs you want to receive notifications to the .env file

#### 1. Add multiple chat IDs to the `.env` file.

**These chat IDs will be the chat IDs of your groups, channels, or users.**

Also, you can add **the chat ID of this bot** to receive incoming notifications for itself.

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_NOTIFY_CHAT_IDS="-978339113;-1001933979183"
```

#### 2. Add a topic for supergroups with premium users (Thread ID)

You can add topic for supergroups with premium users (Thread ID).

**These topics will be the topics of your supergroups.**

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_NOTIFY_CHAT_IDS="-978339113;-1001933979183:topic_1;"
```

#### 3. Add multiple topics for supergroups with premium users (Thread IDs)

You can add multiple topics for each supergroup with premium users (Thread IDs).

```dotenv
TELEGRAM_NOTIFY_CHAT_IDS="-978339113;-1001933979183:topic_1,topic_2;"
```

> **Note:**
> 
> - Please use semicolon ";" to separate chat ids
>   - And use a colon ":" to separate chat ID and topic
>   - And use the comma "," if you want to add multiple topics

---

Now your configuration is complete. And the `.env` file will be like this:

```dotenv
TGN_APP_NAME='Telegram GitHub/GitLab Notify Bot'

# Set your app URL here (Required for the bot to work properly)
TGN_APP_URL=https://123456789.ngrok.io

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=6162840106:AAH3g20lMQIkG_wHHu8R_ngdtG541uzoq4
TELEGRAM_BOT_CHAT_ID=6872320129

# Set the chat IDs that will receive notifications here.
# You can add the owner bot ID, group id, ...
# -------------------------------------------------------
# Note:
# Please use semicolon ";" to separate chat ids
# And use a colon ":" to separate chat ID and thread ID
# And use comma "," if you want to add multiple thread ids
# -------------------------------------------------------
# The environment variable is expected to be in the format:
# "chat_id1;chat_id2:thread_id2;chat_id3:thread_id3_1,thread_id3_2;..."
TELEGRAM_NOTIFY_CHAT_IDS="-978339113;-1001933979183:2,13;6872320129"

TIMEZONE=Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh

PHP_VERSION_SELECTED=8.2
