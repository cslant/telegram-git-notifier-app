## Information

- Send GitHub notifications of your repositories to Telegram Bots, Groups, and Channels.
- The bot must be created using the [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather)

## Requirement

- PHP ^8.0
- Composer
- Telegram Bot
- SSL Certificate

## Installation

First, please clone and install this project via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
composer create-project lbiltech/telegram-bot-github-notify
```

After running the command above, you will have the project installed under `telegram-bot-github-notify` directory,
and the environment file `.env` will be created automatically.

### Create a New Bot

To create a new bot, you need to talk to [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and follow a few simple steps.

1. Open a chat with [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and send `/newbot` command.
2. Enter a friendly name for your bot. This name will be displayed in contact details and elsewhere.
3. Enter a unique username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: `TetrisBot` or `tetris_bot`.
4. Copy the HTTP API access token provided by [BotFather](https://telegram.me/botfather) and paste it into your `.env` file.

```shell
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456789:ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
```

### Get your Chat ID and add it to the .env file

1. Open a chat with your bot.
2. Send a message to your bot.
3. Go to the following URL: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBOTToken>/getUpdates`
4. Look for the `"chat":{"id":` field and copy the number after it. This is your Chat ID.
5. Paste the Chat ID in your `.env` file.

```shell
TELEGRAM_BOT_CHAT_ID=123456789
```

### Set up your domain and SSL certificate

**You need to set up your domain and SSL certificate to use the webhook**. You can build your own server or use a service like [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

In this example, we will use localhost and ngrok to set up domain and webhook:
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download).
2. Run command in terminal: `php -S localhost:8000`
3. Run command in terminal: `ngrok http 8000`
4. Copy the HTTPS URL provided by ngrok and paste it into your `.env` file.

```shell
APP_URL=https://123456789.ngrok.io
```

### Set the webhook

#### Set the webhook from the source code

After setting up your domain and SSL certificate, you need to set up the webhook for your bot. Go to:

```text
<APP_URL>/setWebhook.php
```

> **Note:** Replace `<APP_URL>` with your app URL in .env file.

If you see the following message, it means that the webhook has been sent successfully.

```json
{"ok":true,"result":true,"description":"Webhook was set"}
```

#### Set the webhook manually

If you want to set the webhook manually, you can use the following URL:

```text
https://api.telegram.org/bot<YourBOTToken>/setWebhook?url=<APP_URL>
```

> **Note:** Replace `<YourBOTToken>` with your bot token and `<APP_URL>` with your app URL in .env file.

### Add chat ids you want to receive notifications to the .env file

```shell
TELEGRAM_NOTIFY_CHAT_IDS="-978339113,-1001933979183"
```

Now your configuration is complete. And it will be like this:

```shell
APP_NAME='Telegram Github Notify Bot'

# Set your app URL here
APP_URL=https://123456789.ngrok.io

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=6162840106:AAH3g20lMQIkG_wHHu8R_ngdtG541uzoq4
TELEGRAM_BOT_CHAT_ID=6872320129

# Set your telegram group chat ids here ( please use comma to separate )
TELEGRAM_NOTIFY_CHAT_IDS="-978339113,-1001933979183"

TIMEZONE=Asia/Ho_Chi_Minh
```

## Usage

Now you can send a message to your bot, and you will receive a notification.

```text
/start
```

## Set webhook on your GitHub repository
